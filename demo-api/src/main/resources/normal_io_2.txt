Recently I got a line that I like very much. I love you very much, but I don`t like you anymore.
Intend, you still make me feel  beautiful and exciting, however I have no strength or courage to hug you again.
This sentence makes me feel particularly. Just like you are still in my mind, still in my heart,
Occupy a particularly important  position, however I no longer have any illusions about you.
I can`t control how to unforgettable I am to you. But all about you I have no expectation.
Thought I still miss you, however it`s not for you anymore. So you go. Don`t giving up, beckoning, unforgettable,
be determined and look forward to the future. Give it back to you.
