Recently I got a line that I like very much. I love you very much, but I don`t like you anymore.
Intend, you still make me feel beautiful and exciting, however I have no strength or courage to hug you again.
This sentence makes me feel particularly. Just like you are still in my mind, still in my heart,
Occupy a particularly important position, however I no longer have any illusions about you.
I can`t control how to unforgettable I am to you. But all about you I have no expectation.
Though I still miss you, it`s not for you anymore.
So you go! I will give it back to you of my unwilling, unforgettable, be determined and looking forward to the future.
